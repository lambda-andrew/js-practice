// ==== ADVANCED Array Methods ====

/* Request 1: .forEach()

Display both the name and the mass of the character.  Return an array with only the name and mass shown.  The individual values in the array should look like this "Name: Obi-Wan Kenobi, Mass: 77"

*/

/* Request 2: .map()

Convert all the character names to lower case.  Create a new array named lowerCase and map over each name to convert them all to lower case.  Log the resut.

*/

const lowerCase = [];
//use .map()
console.log(lowerCase);

/* Request 3: .filter()

Find out which characters have a mass less than 100.

*/
const lightweights = [];
//use .filter()
console.log(lightweights);

/* Request 4: .reduce()

If all the characters on the list got in a starship, what would their total weight be?  Find the total mass from all the characters using the .reduce() method.

*/
const massTotal = 0;
//use .reduce()
console.log(massTotal);

/*

Stretch: If you haven't already, convert your array method callbacks into arrow functions.
